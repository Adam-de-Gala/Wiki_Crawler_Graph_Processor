README

A program to crawl wikipedia and find Strongly connected components in the graph. 
Created for my Algorithms class. Partnered with Ben Meeder for this assignment.

TO RUN. 
Define starting wikipeda page in Wiki_Crawler Main, 
Define how "far" out the graph should go in Wiki_Crawler Main
Define the text file for the graph to be output to.

Wiki_Crawler crawler = new Wiki_Crawler("/wiki/Computer_Science", 500, "WikiCS.txt");
/wiki/Computer_Science - > start page
500 -> number of node to go out. (NOT number of max nodes)
WikiCS.txt -> text output. 

 Ben Meeder wrote most of Wiki_Crawler, 
 I wrote most of Graph Processor.
